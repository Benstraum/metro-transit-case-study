# Welcome to my metro transit api case study!

# How to start up this application:
- Download via zip file or clone from github. Once you are in the project run `npm install` to install the necessary packages. Then you can run `npm start` to start p the project in your browser.

# Running the tests
-use the command `npm test` in the terminal to run the tests inside of api.test.tsx


# List of assumptions I made while developing this app:

-The API is fully functional and will not go down during my intended use of it.

- The application was intended for Web use.

- Users understand the symbols used/know the app's intended use.

- Did visual testing in most browsers, but expect mainly firefox/chrome users.
