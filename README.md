# Welcome to my metro transit api case study!

# How to start up this application:
-once downloaded via zip or github open up in your ide of choice (I use VS code).

-run 'npm install' from the root directory of the project in your terminal to download the necessary packages .

-Once finished downloading run 'yarn start' or 'npm start' to start up the project. 

-you can navigate to this project in your browser at localhost:3000

# Running the tests
-use the command npm test in the terminal to run the tests inside of api.test.tsx


# List of assumptions I made while developing this app:

-The API is fully functional and will not go down during my intended use of it.

- The application was intended fully for Web use-while it is responsive-it is not fully compatible with mobile. 

- Users understand the symbols used/know the app's intended use.

- Did visual testing in most browsers, but expect mainly firefox/chrome users.
